  - Design intent is for the player to utilize the portal system that is presented on the map. The reasoning for taking the scarecrow's hat off and moving it to the table is to utilize the players VR controller buttons and to be as precise as possible to make sure that the correct hat is placed in the correct space. The idea is put the hat on the table without pushing the table over.
  - Assets used are the portal/moving systems, the scarecrows, a low poly folding table for the hats, the hats off the scarecrow, and a billboard presenting the directions.
  
  - Unfortunately, I could not code a way for the task that was completed to be acknowledged. I had a hard time trying to implement it into the system no matter what code I attempted to write and for the future, I will proceed to ask questions even if I feel like I know what I'm doing.
